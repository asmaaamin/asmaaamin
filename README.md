# Asmaa Alnajjar - Engineer, Developer & Creative Mind

👋 Hi, I’m Asmaa a tech lover who loves turning ideas into beautiful,
user-friendly websites. Programming isn’t just my job; it’s my creative outlet!
I enjoy making technology more accessible and intuitive for everyone.

I never thought I’d be a teacher, but to my surprise, I discovered a natural
talent for it! I love sharing knowledge, helping others grow, and making complex
topics easy to understand.

## 🎨 Beyond Code

When I’m not busy coding, you’ll find me:

📖 **Reading books** (because knowledge is power!)

🎤 **Creating kids' audiobooks** (bringing stories to life!)

🧶 **Crocheting & embroidery** (because creativity has no limits—whether in code
or thread!)
